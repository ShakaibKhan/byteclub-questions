# Two Sum

## Description

The Hamming distance is the number of bits that differ in corresponding bits between two integers. Given two integers <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> return their Hamming distance.

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1
*Input:*
```json
{
  "x": 1,
  "y": 4
}
```
*Output:*
```json
2
```

### Test Case 2
*Input:*
```json
{
  "x": 1,
  "y": 5
}
```
*Output:*
```json
1
```
### Test Case 3
*Input:*
```json
{
  "x": 7,
  "y": 8
}
```
*Output:*
